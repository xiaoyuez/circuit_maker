## Circuit Maker
This is a toy project that creates customized workout programs for you. It started with my frustration that it is hard to find flexible HIIT (High Intensity Interval Timing) training apps. They either come with a few sets of pre-determined workouts, or do not allow you to create your own timer, or both. I soon realized that each workout has its own unique attributes and can be coded into a data frame. For example, a simple plank works on your abs and arms but not back and legs. It is of medium intensity and it does not require weights. Once you have a table of these workouts, you can select the workouts needed to train certain body parts with your desired training intensity. This is exactly what Circuit Maker is designed to do. 

## Requirements
`python 2.7 or above`

`pandas`

## How to use it
Once you have cloned it, go to terminal and run `~/circuit_maker/circuit_gui.py`, it should automatically start.
